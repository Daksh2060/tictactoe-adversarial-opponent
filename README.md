# Tic-Tac-Toe Adversarial Agent

This is a project template from UC Berkeley, for an adversarial agent. This specific implementation is for playing Tic Tac Toe, offering users the option to choose board size and difficulty level. The agent utilizes various search algorithms including, but not limited to; Alpha-Beta Pruning, Expectimax, and Minimax. Each algorithm is implemented both with and without cutoff distances to allow users to experiment with different strategies and observe their impact on gameplay. The project provides an interactive interface where users can play against the adversarial agent, selecting the board size and difficulty level according to their preference.
